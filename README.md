# v2 personal website

Here's my second go at a personal website. Ideally, this will be much easier to expand on than v1.

## TODO: ✅

- [x] first draft with new design (feature parity with v1)
- [x] deploy to vercel
- [x] move domain
- [ ] add projects/experience section
- [ ] add the floating snowboard 🏂

<br />

**the stack: 🛠️**

> - React with typescript
> - Tailwind css (with a sprinkle of shadcn/ui and AceternityUI reusable components)
> - Next-js
> - Vercel hosting

**getting started: 🏁**

> 1. clone the repository.
> 2. start the development server: `npm run dev`.
> 3. voila! 🍻

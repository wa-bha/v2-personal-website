# v2 personal website

Here's my second go at a personal website. Ideally, this will be much easier to expand on than v1.

## TODO: ✅

- [x] first draft with new design (feature parity with v1)
- [x] deploy to vercel
- [x] move the domains around
- [x] add experience section

*and now the trivial and random stuff...*
- [ ] add the big floating snowboard 🏂
- [ ] mouse trail with flat white's ☕ [@see "Mouse Image Trail"](www.hover.dev/components/other#mouse-image-trail)
- [ ] implement blog framework for nextJS, write ✍️ my first article? [@see prismic](https://prismic.io/blog/nextjs-blog-tutorial)
- [ ] hover effect over experience cards [@see "Following Pointer"](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/following-pointer)

<br />

**the stack: 🛠️**

- React with typescript (NextJS)
- Tailwind css (with a sprinkle of reusable components by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [AceternityUI](https://ui.aceternity.com/))
- Hosted on Vercel

**getting started: 🏁**

1. clone the repository.
2. start the development server: `npm run dev`.
3. voila! 🍻

## TODO: ✅

- ✅ first draft with new design (feature parity with v1)
- ✅ deploy to vercel
- ✅ move the domains around

**_and now for my more trivial ideas..._** ⬜

- ⬜ add the big floating snowboard 🏂
- ⬜ mouse trail with flat white's ☕ [@see "Mouse Image Trail"](https://www.hover.dev/components/other#mouse-image-trail)
- ⬜ implement blog framework for nextJS, write ✍️ my first article? [@see prismic](https://prismic.io/blog/nextjs-blog-tutorial)
- ⬜ hover effect over experience cards [@see "Following Pointer"](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/following-pointer)

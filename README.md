# v2 personal website

Here's my second go at a personal website. Ideally, this will be much easier to expand on than v1.

## the stack 🛠️

- react with typescript
- tailwind css
- next-js
- vercel hosting

getting started 🏁
1. clone the repository.
2. start the development server: `npm run dev`.
4. voila! 🍻
